            <p class="Text"> How “Adventure Time” shaped my well-being, as a person, artist, and aspiring animator
                The most significant time of my life didn’t happen in the blink of an eye, but rather it gradually came to me since my early high school years and until now at college age. Surprisingly, it’s not school-related. It was about a kids’ cartoon that hooked me up since my older brother introduced it to me, called “Adventure Time (with Finn and Jake)”
                <br> <br>
                During a time when I thought my creativity in art was going to be completely banished because of being busy with school, Adventure Time helped me to become inspired again. It’s not mainly from the bad guys Finn and Jake fights, but rather the tender and sweet moments it has. It presents down-to-earth and revealing relations between teenagers, and between young people and parents, teachers and mentors.
